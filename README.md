Take-Home Assignment
Our goal is to give you a mini-project that can be completed roughly under 5 hours. The
focus will be on code that is well-tested, readable, and maintainable. We will have a
discussion in a follow-up session to go over the design and decisions made as well as
work on minor improvements.
The purpose of this assignment is:
1. To create the most natural environment we can to allow you to code in, since we
believe in person sessions donâ€™t always reflect our coding skills
2. To see the kind of code you would produce if you were to work with us
3. To create flexibility in scheduling interviews because you may choose to do this
assignment in the nights or over the weekends.
